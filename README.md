member definition;
} [one or more structure variables];
## AlGORITHM
struct student
    char name[50]
    char div[5]
    long long int prn
    Enter information of students
    for(i=0; i<3; i++)
        Enter PRN
        Enter Name
        Enter DIV
    Displaying Information
    for(i=0; i<3; i++)
        printf-s[i].prn
        puts-s[i].name
        puts-s[i].div
## CONCLUSION
Structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.
Structures are used to represent a record
